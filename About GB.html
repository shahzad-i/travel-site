<h2>History of Gilgit-Baltistan</h2>
<div class="mainccc">
  <div class="aaa">
    <div>
<h3> Ancient Times</h3>
<p>Gilgit-Baltistan was historically part of the Silk Road, connecting China, Central Asia, and the Indian subcontinent.
Ancient inscriptions in Kharosthi, Brahmi, and Sanskrit found in the region show the influence of Buddhism, Hinduism, and Zoroastrianism.
Buddhist monasteries and rock carvings (like those in Hunza and Skardu) indicate that GB was a cultural hub as early as the 1st century CE.</p>

  <div class="bbb">
<h3>Medieval Period</h3>
        <img src="/house.webp" alt="" width="533px" height="300px">
<p>The region was ruled by small local kingdoms and tribal rulers such as:
Maqpon Dynasty in Baltistan (Skardu)
Raja dynasties in Hunza, Nagar, and Yasin
There was frequent conflict and shifting alliances between local rulers, and influence from Kashmir, Tibet, and Central Asia.
Islam was introduced between the 14thâ€“17th centuries, spreading through Sufi saints and traders.</p>

  <div class="ddd">
<h3>ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³ Dogra Rule (1846â€“1947)</h3>
<p>After the Treaty of Amritsar (1846), the region came under the Dogra rulers of Jammu and Kashmir as part of the princely state under British suzerainty.
The people of GB resisted this rule, and tensions remained high due to heavy taxation and repression.</p>

   <div class="eee">
<h3>Liberation and Accession to Pakistan (1947)</h3>
<p>
        <img src="/Liberation.jpg" alt="" width="550px" height="300px">
In November 1947, after the creation of Pakistan, the local Gilgit Scouts revolted against the Dogra governor.
With help from local leaders and tribes, they liberated Gilgit and later merged with Pakistan on November 16, 1947.
The rest of the region, including Baltistan, joined Pakistan during the first Kashmir War (1947â€“48).</p>

<div class="mainiii">
   <div class="ggg">
<h3>Post-1947: Semi-Autonomous Region</h3>
<p>
GB was administered separately from Pakistanâ€™s provinces due to the Kashmir dispute.
The region was governed through federal control and local councils.
In 2009, the Gilgit-Baltistan Empowerment and Self-Governance Order was introduced:
Gave the region a Legislative Assembly
Allowed local elections and partial self-rule</p>

<h3>Present Status</h3>
          <img src="/present state of gilgit.png" alt=""width="533px" height="300px">
<p>Gilgit-Baltistan is not yet a full constitutional province of Pakistan, but efforts are ongoing to grant it that status.
It remains strategically important, especially due to the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) and its proximity to borders with China, India, and Afghanistan.</p>
